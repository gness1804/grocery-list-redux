##Grocery List in Redux

[Check it out!](https://gness1804.github.io/grocery-list-redux/)

This is a version of my grocery list application built with Redux. It is similar to the [previous version](https://github.com/gness1804/grocery-list-react) except that it includes the following additional features:

* A "Pantry" section with commonly-purchased items. The user can click/tap on any of these items and it will be added to the list.
* The option to show a given item as "In Cart." This applies a special styling to the item but it does not delete it from the page. The user can toggle this option on and off.
* The "edit item" functionality now works; the user can edit any item that is currently on the page.
* User can now delete all items in the cart by pressing a new button.

In general, I found that Redux makes it significantly easier to maintain state and to pass items between components.
